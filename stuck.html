<b>“Never give up on something that you can't go a day without thinking about.” <br>-Winston Churchill</b>
As a guitar player, you have a different kind of “ear” that non-musicians don’t have. 

I think about guitar every day. 
But I don’t feel like pushing myself to get better at guitar every day. 
If I were to ever stop playing guitar, it probably wouldn’t be because I just “up and quit”
one day.
I imagine it would be a much slower process: 
Every day feeling less motivated to practice. Then starting to dread practicing.
Then eventually never picking up my guitar again.
And that would fricking suck. 
Because I love guitar. I want to be able to play like a total boss. And giving up
on that dream would feel like a defeat. 
But the truth is, I’m not immune to giving up. And neither are you.
It’s not our fault. We’re human, and if we’re honest, most days we don’t feel very motivated to
work hard at achieving our (admittedly difficult) goals.
So how do you achieve a big goal, like learning to play guitar, when your motivation is like a roller 
coaster all the time?
Well for one thing, you can’t just force yourself to do it. Forcing things is like starting a marathon
out by sprinting as fast as you can. 
You’ll race ahead of everybody else… for about a minute. Tops. 
But then you’re screwed for the rest of the marathon, because you just used up all your energy, and it’s 
going to be nearly impossible to recover for the next 25.9 miles 
(plus now you probably have a side ache and feel like barfing).
No, the secret is actually to do the opposite.
